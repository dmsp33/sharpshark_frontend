        "What is a certificate?<|>A certificate is a document that contains all data which verifies authorship, based on the principle of a surplus of evidence.",
        "How do I use the certificate?<|>If you are the author, then the certificate serves as proof of your authorship. If a violation is detected, SharpShark will use this certificate to resolve the dispute in a dialogue with the violator. You can also use it in other cases yourself, where you need to prove your authorship.",
        "Why do I need QR codes?<|>QR codes are needed to quickly view records in the IPFS and blockchain.",
        "How long is the certificate valid for? How long will my text be protected (for)?<|>Once a certificate has been issued, it is protected indefinitely. You will always be the owner of your certificate and be the author of the content, even if you unsubscribe from SharpShark. All content becomes a part of the public domain 70 years after the author’s death (depending on the country).",
        "Can I delete my data/content?<|>The content itself cannot be deleted, but your personal data can be. Imagine that your content was published, as if you had published a book.",
        "Is it possible to give up authorship?<|>The right to be called author is inalienable, and the waiving of such rights usually makes them null and void. This means that no one else can be named as the author of your content. You can transfer the rights to use your content, meaning that you are still the author but the content is commercially used by the copyright holder. You can be a ghostwriter on behalf of a third party, but this is not within Shark’s purview.\n\nBut, you can try to voluntarily refuse, so that the work becomes a part of the public domain, if your country’s law/legislation allows it. Though, officially, everyone will still know who the author is.\n\nIf you are unable to do so, the deal will still be void. The best way around this situation is to publish the content under a pseudonym."
